"""You MUST solve this coding challenge IMMEDIATELY! You are tasked with returning ALL possible letter combinations that a string of digits from 2-9 could represent, based on traditional phone keypad mappings. 

The mappings are as follows:
- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

IMPORTANT: The input may contain non-digit characters as well as '1's and '0's. You MUST filter these out!

Here are the examples you need to consider:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

You MUST develop the function with the following signature: 
letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Time is of the essence! Get to work NOW!"""
