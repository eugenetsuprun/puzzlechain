"""URGENT: You are tasked with a critical coding challenge that demands immediate attention! Given a string that may contain digits from 2-9, your mission is to return ALL possible letter combinations these numbers could represent, based on the classic telephone button mapping. It is vital to filter out any non-digit characters, including ones and zeros, as they do not contribute to the combinations.

Here's the essential mapping you must use:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

You must be precise in your implementation, as time is of the essence. Consider the following examples to guide your function:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a", "b", "c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]

Keep the following constraints in mind:
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

Act swiftly! The function signature you must use is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. Time is ticking!"""
