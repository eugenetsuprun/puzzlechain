"""You are kindly requested to create a function that takes a string of digits, specifically those ranging from 2 to 9, and returns all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. The answer may be presented in any order you prefer.

Please utilize the following mapping of digits to letters, which resembles the layout on telephone keypads:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

It is important to note that the input may include non-digit characters, as well as the digits one or zero. Therefore, please ensure to filter these out.

Here are a few examples to illustrate your task:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

For your reference, the constraints are as follows:
- The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in digits will fall within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you are to work with is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str] 

Thank you for your efforts in addressing this task!"""
