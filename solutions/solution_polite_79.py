"""Please consider a scenario where you are given a string consisting of digits ranging from 2 to 9. Your task is to return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent, with the output being in any order you prefer.

As a reference, here is the mapping of digits to letters, similar to what you would find on a telephone keypad:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may contain non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, which you should filter out.

For your reference, here are a few examples:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

You are kindly requested to keep in mind the following constraints during your implementation:

- The length of digits must be between 0 and 4, inclusive.
- Each character in digits (i.e., digits[i]) should be a digit within the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str] 

Thank you for your attention to this task!"""
