"""You are kindly asked to write a function that takes a string containing digits from 2 to 9 inclusive and returns all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. The output order can be flexible.

For reference, here is the mapping of digits to letters similar to those found on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input string may contain non-digit characters, such as ones or zeros. It would be appreciated if you could filter those out.

Here are a few examples to guide you:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

As a gentle reminder, please ensure that the length of the digits string adheres to the constraints of 0 to 4, and that each digit in the string falls within the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your implementation should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_letters = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_letters, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
        return []
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(filtered_digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = digit_to_letters[filtered_digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
