"""Alright, listen up! You’ve got a string full of digits from 2 to 9, and your pathetic job is to figure out every possible letter combo that these numbers could represent. Just like how those old-school telephone buttons worked, you know? 

Here’s the lame mapping you’re working with:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

Now, if you happen to stumble upon any non-digit junk, like ones or zeros, toss them out like yesterday's trash. 

Check out these examples, and try not to mess it up:

Example 1:  
Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []  

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]  

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

Just so you know, the constraints say you can’t have more than 4 digits, and those digits better be between '2' and '9'. 

Now go ahead and write your function: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. And for the love of all that’s decent, try not to screw it up!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
    digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    
    if not digits:
