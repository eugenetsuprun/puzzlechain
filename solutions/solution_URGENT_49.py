"""You must tackle this challenge IMMEDIATELY! Given a string containing digits from 2-9, your task is to return ALL POSSIBLE letter combinations that the number could represent. Time is of the essence, and your solution needs to be effective and efficient! 

Here's the mapping you must use:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

IMPORTANT: The input may include non-digit characters, including 0s and 1s, which you must FILTER OUT! 

Keep your focus sharp! Here are some examples to guide your implementation:

1. Input: digits = "23" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = "" 
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2" 
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember, the constraints are as follows:
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

Your function signature should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

This is CRITICAL â€“ get to it NOW!"""
