"""Given a string that consists of digits between 2 and 9, your task is to generate all possible combinations of letters that correspond to the digits, based on a traditional telephone keypad layout. Please filter out any non-digit characters, as well as any instances of '1' or '0'.

Below is the mapping of digits to letters:

- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

You should implement the function with the following signature:
```python
letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]
```

Here are some examples to illustrate:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Keep in mind the constraints:
- The length of digits can be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit must be in the range ['2', '9']."""
