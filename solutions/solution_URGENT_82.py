"""You MUST solve this pressing coding challenge IMMEDIATELY! Given a string filled with digits from 2-9, your task is to return EVERY possible letter combination these digits can represent. This isn't just a simple query; the combinations should be returned in ANY order you choose.

The mapping of digits to letters is critical and follows the classic telephone keypad layout:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Be aware that the input might include non-digit characters, 1s, or 0s—YOUR MISSION is to filter those OUT!

Consider the examples below as you strategize your approach:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember these constraints:
- The length of digits is between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in digits must be between '2' and '9'.

You MUST implement the function with the following signature: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Time is of the essence—get to it NOW!"""
