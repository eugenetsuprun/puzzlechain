"""You are kindly requested to devise a solution for a coding task that involves generating all possible letter combinations corresponding to a string of digits ranging from 2 to 9. Please consider the mapping of digits to letters as typically found on telephone keypads, as outlined below:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

For your task, please ensure to filter out any non-digit characters, as well as any instances of the digits 1 or 0. 

To further illustrate your requirements, here are some examples:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please note the constraints for your implementation:
- The length of the digits string should be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the string must be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you should use is: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Thank you for your attention to this task!"""
