"""You need to act fast! Your task is to write a function that takes a string of digits between 2 and 9 and returns all possible letter combinations those digits could represent, just like the old telephone keypads. 

Here's the mapping you must use:

- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

Be careful! You must ignore any non-digit characters, zeros, or ones. 

Check these examples closely:

1. Input: "23" -> Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
2. Input: "" -> Output: []
3. Input: "2" -> Output: ["a","b","c"]
4. Input: "12*30" -> Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Stay focused on the constraints: 
- The length of the input string can be between 0 and 4.
- Ensure digits are in the range ['2', '9'].

Your function should look like this: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Time is of the essenceâ€”get it done NOW!"""
