"""URGENT: You need to tackle this coding task IMMEDIATELY! Given a string of digits from 2-9, your mission is to return ALL possible letter combinations that these numbers can represent, similar to the mappings on old telephone keypads. 

Hereâ€™s the mapping you must use:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

IMPORTANT: Filter out any non-digit characters, including zeros and ones. 

You must handle the following scenarios with extreme precision:

1. Input: "23" should yield Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
2. Input: "" should yield Output: []
3. Input: "2" should yield Output: ["a","b","c"]
4. Input: "12*30" should yield Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember, the function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. 

Time is of the essence! Get to work!"""
