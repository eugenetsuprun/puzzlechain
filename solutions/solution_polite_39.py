"""You are kindly requested to devise a solution that takes a string consisting of digits from 2 to 9 inclusive and returns all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent. It would be greatly appreciated if you could present the answer in any order you prefer.

For your reference, here is the mapping of digits to letters, similar to that found on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please be mindful that the input may contain non-digit characters, such as ones or zeros, which should be filtered out. 

Here are some examples to guide your implementation:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please ensure that your solution adheres to the following constraints:
- The length of digits should be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in the string should be in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Thank you very much for your attention to this task!"""
