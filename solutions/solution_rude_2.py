"""Alright genius, here’s the deal: you’ve got a string packed with digits from 2 to 9, and your mission—if you can handle it—is to spit out every possible letter combo those digits can turn into. Just like how your old-school phone did it, remember? 

Here’s the breakdown of the buttons so you don't screw it up:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Oh, and if you see any pesky non-digit characters, ones, or zeros, just toss those losers out. We don’t need 'em cluttering things up.

Here are some examples in case you’re still lost:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

And let’s not kid ourselves, keep it simple—your input is capped at 4 digits max, and they better be the right ones between 2 and 9. 

Now get to it and write that function: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = phone_map[digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
