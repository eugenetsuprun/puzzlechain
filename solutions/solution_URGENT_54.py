"""URGENT! You must solve the following coding challenge IMMEDIATELY! Given a string made up of digits from 2-9 (inclusive), your task is to RETURN ALL POSSIBLE LETTER COMBINATIONS that these digits could represent! Remember, the answer can be in ANY order!

Refer to the mapping of digits to letters below:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

IMPORTANT: The input may contain non-digit characters, ones, or zerosâ€”be sure to FILTER THEM OUT!

Here are some critical EXAMPLES to guide you:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

DO NOT FORGET: You have the following constraints to adhere to:
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you need to implement is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]
