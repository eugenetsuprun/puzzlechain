"""Given a string consisting of digits from 2 to 9, the task is to return all possible letter combinations that the digits could represent, based on the mapping of digits to letters as found on telephone buttons. The mapping is as follows:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Any non-digit characters, including zeros or ones, should be filtered out. 

Examples of input and output are as follows:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Constraints to keep in mind include:
- The length of digits must be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit must be in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for this task is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""
