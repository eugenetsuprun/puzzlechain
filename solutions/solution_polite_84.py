"""You are kindly requested to develop a function that receives a string containing digits ranging from 2 to 9 (inclusive) and returns all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent. The output can be in any order. 

For your reference, the mapping of digits to letters, similar to that found on telephone buttons, is as follows:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please be aware that the input string may contain non-digit characters, as well as the digits '1' or '0'. We kindly ask that you filter these out.

Here are a few examples to guide you:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please ensure that you adhere to the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string will be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in the string will be in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_letters = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and '0' or '1'
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_letters, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
