"""Alright, genius, listen up! You’ve got this string of digits from 2 to 9, and your job is to spit out all the possible letter combos that these numbers could represent. And yeah, you’re gonna return this mess in any order you please.

Here's the deal with the digits and their corresponding letters, just like those ancient phone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Oh, and if you see any non-digit characters, or pesky ones and zeros, just toss 'em out like yesterday's trash. 

Now, check out these examples to get your head around it:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

And don’t forget, you’re limited to strings of length 0 to 4, and the digits should be between '2' and '9'. 

Now get to it and write that function: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. And try not to mess it up!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []

        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and '1' or '0'
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_letters, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
