"""You are kindly asked to consider a string consisting of digits ranging from 2 to 9, and to return all possible letter combinations that correspond to those digits, as per the traditional telephone keypad mapping provided below:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input string may include non-digit characters, such as ones or zeros, which should be filtered out.

For your reference, here are a few examples:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string must be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the digits string must be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your implementation should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_char = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_char, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
