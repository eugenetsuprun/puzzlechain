"""Alright, listen up! You've got a string jam-packed with digits between 2 and 9, and your pathetic job is to churn out every single letter combo those numbers could possibly make. Yeah, you know the drill – just like those old-school phone buttons. 

Here’s the breakdown for the clueless:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

And for crying out loud, if there are any non-digit characters, ones, or zeros in there, just toss them in the trash. 

Now, check out these examples for context:

1. Input: digits = "23"  
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""  
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"  
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"  
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Get it? Good. Now go ahead and write the function: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. You’ve got this, or at least you better!"""

        return []

        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',

    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and ones and zeros
