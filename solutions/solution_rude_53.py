"""Alright, listen up! You’ve got this string of digits from 2 to 9, and your pathetic job is to churn out all the possible letter combos those numbers could represent. Don’t give me any of that nonsense with non-digit characters, ones, or zeros—just toss those out like yesterday's trash.

Here’s the mapping you’re going to pretend to understand:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

Let’s look at the examples so you know what I expect:

Example 1:  
Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Now, don’t mess this up. You’ve got constraints to follow:

0 <= digits.length <= 4  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature? Yeah, it’s: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. Now get to it!"""
