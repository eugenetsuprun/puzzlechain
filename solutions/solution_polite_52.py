"""Given a string that contains digits ranging from 2 to 9, I would be most grateful if you could assist in returning all possible letter combinations that these numbers may represent. Please feel free to return the answer in any order you find convenient.

For your reference, below is the mapping of digits to letters, reminiscent of the letter representation on telephone keypads:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

It would be appreciated if you could filter out any non-digit characters, as well as ones and zeros, from the input string.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the expected output:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please adhere to the following constraints:
- The length of the digits should be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in the input should fall within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your consideration is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""
