"""You have an urgent coding challenge that needs to be tackled immediately! The task is to take a string made up of digits from 2 to 9 and return all the possible letter combinations these digits can represent, similar to how a traditional telephone keypad works. 

Hereâ€™s the crucial mapping you must remember:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Be vigilant! The input may contain non-digit characters including ones and zeros, so make sure to filter those out.

Here are examples to guide your implementation:

1. Input: digits = "23" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = "" 
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2" 
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Keep in mind the constraints: 
- The length of digits is between 0 and 4.
- Each digit is within the range ['2', '9'].

Your function must have this signature: 
`letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`

Time is of the essence! Get to work and solve this right away!"""
