"""Please implement a function that takes a string of digits ranging from 2 to 9 and returns all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent, similar to the letters associated with telephone buttons. Kindly note that any non-digit characters, as well as any ones or zeros, should be filtered out. 

For your reference, here is the mapping of digits to letters:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please consider the following examples to understand the expected output:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Additionally, please adhere to the constraints where the length of the digits should be between 0 and 4, and the characters in the string must be in the digit range ['2', '9'].

The function signature should be as follows: 
```python
def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
``` 

Thank you for your attention to this task!"""
