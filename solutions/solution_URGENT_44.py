"""You are faced with an urgent coding challenge! Your task is to take a string of digits (ranging from 2 to 9) and produce all possible letter combinations these numbers could represent, similar to the letters on a telephone keypad. 

The digits may include non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, so make sure to filter those out immediately! 

Hereâ€™s the critical mapping you need to remember:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

You MUST ensure that the function is efficient and adheres to the constraints outlined below:

- The input string length can be between 0 and 4.
- Each character should be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

Here are some examples to guide you:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

You need to implement the function with the signature: 
letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Time is of the essence! Get to it!"""

    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
