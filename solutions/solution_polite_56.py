"""Given a string that contains digits ranging from 2 to 9, your task is to return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Please present the answer in any order that you find suitable.

For your reference, here is a mapping of the digits to their corresponding letters, similar to those found on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

It is worth noting that the number may contain non-digit characters, such as ones or zeros; kindly filter those out.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the task:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the constraints:
- The length of the digits string should be between 0 and 4, inclusive.
- Each character in digits must be a digit within the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your solution is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

    }
