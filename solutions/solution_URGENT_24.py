"""You MUST act NOW! Your task is to create an urgent solution for the following coding problem: 

Given a string filled with digits from 2-9, you need to return all possible letter combinations that these numbers can represent. The mapping is straightforward, just like a classic telephone keypad:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

However, be on HIGH ALERT! The input might include non-digit characters, ones, or zeros — your FIRST priority is to filter those out completely!

Here are some critical examples to guide you:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember, the constraints are strict:

- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- Each digits[i] must be a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you need to follow is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str] 

Time is of the essence — execute this challenge with precision!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_char = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_char, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
        return []
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(filtered_digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_chars = digit_to_char[filtered_digits[index]]
        for char in possible_chars:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + char)

    backtrack(0, "")
