"""You have an urgent task ahead of you! Given a string filled with digits from 2-9, your mission is to return all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent—think of the classic telephone keypad! 

Here’s the critical mapping you need to remember:
- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Beware! The input string may contain non-digit characters such as ones or zeros. Your first step? Filter those out immediately!

Let’s run through some urgent examples to clarify your objective:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The constraints are straightforward:
- The length of the digits string is between 0 and 4.
- Each character in digits is guaranteed to be a digit between '2' and '9'.

Your function must be defined as: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Time is of the essence! Get to work and deliver those combinations!"""
