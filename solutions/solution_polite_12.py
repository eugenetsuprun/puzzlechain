"""Please consider the following task: You are given a string that contains digits ranging from 2 to 9, and your objective is to return all possible letter combinations that correspond to the number. The output may be presented in any order.

Below is the mapping of each digit to its corresponding letters, similar to the layout found on telephone keypads:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

It is important to note that the input may also include non-digit characters, as well as the digits one or zero. Therefore, please ensure to filter out any such characters.

Here are a few examples to illustrate:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

For your implementation, please consider the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string is between 0 and 4 inclusive.
- Each character in the string is a digit within the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature to be used is: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. 

Thank you for your attention to this task!"""
