"""Alright genius, here’s the deal: you’ve got this string with digits from 2 to 9, and your task is to figure out every possible letter combo those numbers can make. Yeah, just like those old-school phone keypads. Here's the mapping if your memory needs a jog:

Button 2: ABC
Button 3: DEF
Button 4: GHI
Button 5: JKL
Button 6: MNO
Button 7: PQRS
Button 8: TUV
Button 9: WXYZ

And no, we don’t want any of those pesky non-digit characters, ones, or zeros messing things up. Filter that junk out.

Let’s look at some examples that might actually help you understand what you're supposed to do:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Oh, and by the way, make sure the length of your digits string is between 0 and 4. That’s it. Now go ahead and make your function: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. Good luck, you’ll need it!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_char = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_char, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
        return []
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(filtered_digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = digit_to_char[filtered_digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
