"""Alright, genius, here’s what you need to do. You’ve got a string of digits from 2 to 9, and your job is to spit out all the possible letter combos those numbers could represent. Think of the old-school phone buttons—each number’s got a bunch of letters tied to it, like this:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

Now, let's get something straight: if there are any non-digit characters, ones, or zeros hanging around, toss them out. We only care about the valid digits.

Here are some examples to help you wrap your head around it:

Example 1:  
Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

And just so you know, the length of your digit string can be from 0 to 4 characters, and each character must be a digit from '2' to '9'. 

You got that? Get to work and make it happen. The function signature should look like this: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out invalid characters
    digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = phone_map[digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
