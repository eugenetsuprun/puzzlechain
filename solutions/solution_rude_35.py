"""Okay genius, listen up. You’ve got a string made up of digits from 2 to 9, and your job is to spit out every possible letter combo that those numbers stand for. Yeah, just like how you’d dial on an old school phone. 

Here’s the lowdown on what each digit means:

- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

Oh, and if there are any non-digit characters, ones, or zeros? Just toss 'em. They don't belong here.

Check out these examples so you don’t screw it up:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Keep it simple: you’ve got constraints – the length of your digits can’t be more than 4, and they must be between '2' and '9'. 

Your function should look like this: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. Now get to it!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = phone_map[digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
