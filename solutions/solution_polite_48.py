"""Please consider the following coding task: You are asked to take a string that contains digits from 2 to 9 and return all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent. You are welcome to return the results in any order you prefer.

The mapping of digits to letters resembles the layout found on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may include non-digit characters, as well as the digits '1' or '0', which you should filter out.

For your reference, here are some examples:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:
- The length of the input string can range from 0 to 4.
- Each character in the input string will be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function you will implement should have the following signature: 
```python
def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
``` 

Thank you for your attention to this task!"""
