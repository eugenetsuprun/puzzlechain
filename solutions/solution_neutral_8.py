"""Given a string composed of digits ranging from 2 to 9, your task is to return all potential letter combinations that the number could represent. The output can be in any order.

Refer to the mapping of digits to letters, similar to the layout on telephone keypads:

- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

If the number includes non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, they should be disregarded.

Examples:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Constraints:

- The length of the digits string can range from 0 to 4.
- Each digit in the string is in the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""
