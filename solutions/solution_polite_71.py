"""Given a string comprised of digits ranging from 2 to 9, your task is to return all possible letter combinations that the number can represent. Please feel free to return the answer in any order you prefer.

To assist you, here is a mapping of digits to letters, similar to those found on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Kindly note that the input may contain non-digit characters, as well as ones and zeros. We would appreciate it if you could filter these out.

For your reference, here are some examples:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string will be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the digits string must be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you should use is: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. 

Thank you very much for your attention to this task!"""
