"""Given a string that consists of digits ranging from 2 to 9, your task is to find all possible combinations of letters that the digits could represent. The combinations should be returned in any order.

Refer to the mapping of digits to letters as outlined below:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Any non-digit characters, as well as the digits one and zero, should be disregarded.

Examples for your reference:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Constraints to consider:

- The length of the digits string is between 0 and 4, inclusive.
- Each character in the digits string is a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your implementation should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_letters = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = digit_to_letters[digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_letters, digits))
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
