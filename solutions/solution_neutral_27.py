"""Given a string that contains digits from 2 to 9, the task is to return all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent, based on a standard mapping similar to that of a telephone keypad. 

The mapping is as follows:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Any non-digit characters, including digits '0' and '1', should be filtered out.

Here are some examples to illustrate:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the constraints:
- The length of digits is between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in the string is in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""
