"""URGENT! You need to tackle this coding challenge immediately: Given a string of digits (2-9), your mission is to return ALL possible letter combinations these digits could represent, just like the old telephone keypads! 

Hereâ€™s the critical mapping you must follow:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

IMPORTANT: Any non-digit characters, as well as '1's and '0's, MUST be filtered out. 

Time is of the essence! Here are the urgent examples you should consider:

1. Input: digits = "23"  
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""  
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"  
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"  
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Your function signature must be: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`

Get started on this NOW! The clock is ticking!"""
