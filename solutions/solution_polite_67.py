"""Please create a function that takes a string consisting of digits from 2 to 9 and returns all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent. You may refer to the mapping of digits to letters as seen on telephone keypads, which is as follows:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

It is important to note that the input might contain non-digit characters, as well as the digits one and zero. Kindly filter these out before processing.

For your reference, here are some examples:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please ensure that your function adheres to the following constraints:
- The length of the input string should be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the input string should be a digit from the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature should be as follows: 
```python
def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
``` 

Thank you for your assistance with this task!"""
