"""You have an urgent coding challenge that demands your immediate attention! The task is to take a string composed of digits between 2-9 and generate every possible letter combination that corresponds to those digits, just like on a traditional telephone keypad. 

Here's the mapping you need to keep in mind:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Be on the lookout for any non-digit characters, including ones and zeros, as you are required to filter them out efficiently!

Consider these examples as your guidelines:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember, you must adhere to the constraints where the length of the digits can range from 0 to 4, and each digit must be between '2' and '9'.

Your function declaration is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Time is of the essence—get started now!"""

        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
