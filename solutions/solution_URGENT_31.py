"""You need to tackle a crucial coding challenge right NOW! The task is to process a string of digits from 2 to 9 and generate all possible letter combinations that correspond to those digits, using the traditional phone keypad mapping. This includes filtering out any non-digit characters, as well as zeros and ones!

Here's the mapping youâ€™ll need to work with:
- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

**Time is of the essence!** 

You have to implement the function with the following signature: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`

Consider these examples to guide your solution:

1. **Input:** digits = "23"  
   **Expected Output:** ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. **Input:** digits = ""  
   **Expected Output:** []

3. **Input:** digits = "2"  
   **Expected Output:** ["a","b","c"]

4. **Input:** digits = "12*30"  
   **Expected Output:** ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

**Remember!** Constraints dictate that the length of digits should be between 0 and 4. Each digit must be in the range from '2' to '9'. 

You have the power to solve this! Get coding NOW!"""
