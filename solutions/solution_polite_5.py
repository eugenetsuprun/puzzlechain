"""Given a string that contains digits from 2 to 9, could you please return all the possible letter combinations that these numbers might represent? Feel free to present the answer in any order.

For your reference, below is a mapping of the digits to their corresponding letters, similar to what you would find on a telephone keypad:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may contain non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, which should be filtered out.

Here are a few examples to assist you:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:
- The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit in the input will be in the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your solution should be: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Thank you for your consideration!"""
