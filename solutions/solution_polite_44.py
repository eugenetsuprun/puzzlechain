"""Given a string that consists of digits ranging from 2 to 9, may I kindly ask you to return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent? You may present the answer in any order that you prefer.

Below is the mapping of digits to letters, similar to the layout found on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may contain non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, which you are encouraged to filter out.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the task:

Example 1:

- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:

- The length of digits can vary from 0 to 4.
- Each digit in the string will be within the range of ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your implementation should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str] 

Thank you for your efforts!"""
