"""Please provide a string comprised of digits ranging from 2 to 9, and your task will be to return all possible letter combinations that these digits may represent, in any order that you prefer. Below is a helpful mapping of each digit to its corresponding letters, similar to what you would find on a telephone keypad:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

If the input string contains any non-digit characters, ones, or zeros, kindly filter those out before processing.

For your reference, here are some examples of inputs and outputs:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please ensure that your implementation adheres to the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string should be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the digits string must be a digit from '2' to '9'.

The function signature for your solution should be: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Thank you for your attention to detail in this task!"""
