"""You are kindly requested to consider a task where you will be provided with a string consisting of digits ranging from 2 to 9. Your objective is to return all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent, and you may present the answer in any order you wish.

For your reference, the mapping of digits to letters is as follows:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please be aware that the string may contain non-digit characters, as well as the digits one or zero, which you should filter out accordingly.

Here are some examples to illustrate the task:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- Each digit in digits is within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your implementation should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Thank you for your attention to this task, and I wish you the best of luck in completing it!"""
