"""URGENT: You must solve this crucial problem immediately! Given a string of digits ranging from 2-9, your objective is to return all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent. Remember, the mapping is based on traditional telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Be aware that the input may contain non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, which you must filter out WITHOUT FAIL!

Examples to guide you:

1. Input: digits = "23" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = "" 
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2" 
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Constraints you cannot ignore:

- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- Each digits[i] is guaranteed to be in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you must implement is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Act fast and deliver the solution ASAP! Time is of the essence!"""
