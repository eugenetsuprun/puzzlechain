"""I would be grateful if you could help me with a coding task. The task involves taking a string that contains digits from 2 to 9, and returning all possible letter combinations that the number may represent, similar to the mappings found on telephone buttons. 

Hereâ€™s the mapping for your reference:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may contain non-digit characters, ones, or zeros, which should be filtered out.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the task:

1. For the input `digits = "23"`, the expected output is `["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]`.
2. If the input is `digits = ""`, the output should simply be `[]`.
3. For the input `digits = "2"`, the output would be `["a","b","c"]`.
4. In the case of `digits = "12*30"`, the output should again be `["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]`.

The constraints for this task are that the length of `digits` can vary from 0 to 4, and each character in `digits` must be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

I would appreciate it if you could provide a function signature for this task as well: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Thank you very much for your assistance!"""
