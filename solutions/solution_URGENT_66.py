"""You must solve this coding task IMMEDIATELY! Given a string made up of digits from 2-9, your job is to return ALL possible letter combinations that correspond to those digits, just like the letters on a telephone keypad! 

Hereâ€™s the mapping you need to remember:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Be careful! The input number may contain non-digit characters, zeroes, or ones that you must FILTER OUT before processing. 

Consider these crucial examples to guide your solution:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember, the length of the digits string will be between 0 to 4, and each character must be in the range ['2', '9'].

Time is of the essence! The function signature you need to implement is: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Get to work NOW!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []

        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only 2-9
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
