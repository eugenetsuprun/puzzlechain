"""You need to act NOW! Given a string of digits ranging from 2-9, your task is to return ALL possible letter combinations that these digits could form! Remember, this is just like deciphering a phone keypad! 

Here’s the crucial mapping you must follow:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

IMPORTANT: The input may contain non-digit characters, as well as ones or zeros, which you MUST filter out!

GET READY for these examples to guide you:

1. Input: digits = "23" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = "" 
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2" 
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30" 
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

ACT NOW and remember to adhere to these constraints:

- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

Your function signature must be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Time is of the essence—let's see what you can do!"""

        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
