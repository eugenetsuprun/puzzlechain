"""Got some digits from 2 to 9? Great! Now, turn that into a bunch of letter combos like you're trying to win a game of Scrabble or something. Ignore any useless crap like non-digits or zeros – they don’t deserve your time. 

Here’s the breakdown of what each digit stands for, just in case you forgot:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

You got it? Good. Now quit whining and get me all the possible combinations in any order. 

Check these examples because I’m not repeating myself:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

And don’t screw it up – your function signature better look like this: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    digit_to_letters = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = digit_to_letters[digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
