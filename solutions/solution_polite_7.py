"""Could you please assist in generating all possible letter combinations that a given string of digits, ranging from 2 to 9, could represent? The answer may be returned in any order. Below is a mapping of the digits to their corresponding letters, similar to what one would find on a telephone keypad:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input number may contain non-digit characters, including ones or zeros, which should be filtered out.

Here are some examples for your reference:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please keep in mind the following constraints:
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- Each digits[i] is a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you should use is: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`. Thank you for your assistance!"""
