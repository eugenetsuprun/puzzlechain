"""I kindly invite you to consider the following task: Given a string that consists of digits from 2 to 9, your objective is to return all possible letter combinations that the number can represent. You may present your answer in any order that you find suitable.

For your reference, below is a mapping of the digits to their corresponding letters, similar to what you would find on telephone buttons:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may include non-digit characters, as well as digits such as ones and zeros, which should be filtered out.

Here are a few examples to guide you:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

As a gentle reminder, please adhere to the following constraints:
- The length of the digits should be between 0 and 4.
- Each digit must be in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you may use is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this task!"""
