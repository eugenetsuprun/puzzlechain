"""Alright genius, here’s the deal. You’ve got this string of digits from 2 to 9, and your job is to churn out all those letter combos that those numbers can spit out. You know, like how old-school phones used to work. 

Check out the mapping:

- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

By the way, if your precious number has any of those pesky non-digit characters, zeros, or ones, just toss 'em out like yesterday's garbage.

Here’s how you’re gonna prove you can actually code:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

And just to keep you in line, remember this: 0 <= digits.length <= 4, and digits[i] better be a digit from ['2', '9']. 

Now go ahead and write that function: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]. Show me what you got!"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and invalid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
        return []
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(filtered_digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = phone_map[filtered_digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)

    backtrack(0, "")
