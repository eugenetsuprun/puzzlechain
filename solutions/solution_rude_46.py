"""Alright, listen up! You’ve got a string made up of digits from 2 to 9, and your job is to dig up all those possible letter combos that those numbers can throw at you. Just like the old school phone buttons, here’s the rundown:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

Oh, and if you spot any non-digit characters, ones, or zeros in that string, just kick 'em to the curb. We only want the good stuff.

Now, let’s see some examples to make it crystal clear:

Example 1:  
Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

And here’s the deal: your input string can’t be longer than 4 digits, and it better only have digits between '2' and '9'. 

Now, get cracking on that function with this signature:  
letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and invalid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in phone_map, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
        return []
    
    def backtrack(index: int, path: str):
        if index == len(filtered_digits):
            combinations.append(path)
            return
        possible_letters = phone_map[filtered_digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, path + letter)
    
    combinations = []
    backtrack(0, "")
    return combinations
