"""You are kindly requested to devise a solution for an interview-style coding task. The task is to take a string composed of digits ranging from 2 to 9 and return all possible letter combinations that these digits could represent, following the mapping of letters as found on telephone buttons.

The mapping is as follows:
- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input string may include non-digit characters, as well as the digits 1 or 0, which should be filtered out.

Here are some examples for your reference:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please be mindful of the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string will be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the string must be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your implementation should be: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]` 

Thank you for your attention to this task!"""
