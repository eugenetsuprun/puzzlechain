"""Given a string composed of digits ranging from 2 to 9, the task is to return all possible letter combinations that correspond to those digits, based on the traditional mapping found on telephone keypads. The output should be in any order.

The mapping of digits to letters is as follows:

- 2: ABC
- 3: DEF
- 4: GHI
- 5: JKL
- 6: MNO
- 7: PQRS
- 8: TUV
- 9: WXYZ

Any non-digit characters, as well as the digits 0 and 1, should be ignored.

Examples:

1. Input: digits = "23"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

2. Input: digits = ""
   Output: []

3. Input: digits = "2"
   Output: ["a","b","c"]

4. Input: digits = "12*30"
   Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Constraints:

- The length of the digits string is between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the digits string is a digit from the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for this task is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""
