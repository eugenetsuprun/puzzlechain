"""You are kindly invited to solve a coding task that involves generating letter combinations from a given string of digits ranging from 2 to 9. Your objective is to return all possible combinations of letters that these digits could represent, in any order you prefer.

To assist you, here is a mapping of the digits to their corresponding letters, similar to what you would find on a telephone keypad:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input may contain non-digit characters, as well as digits 0 or 1, which should be filtered out. 

Here are a few examples to illustrate the expected input and output:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Please adhere to the following constraints:
- The length of the digits string can be between 0 and 4.
- Each character in the digits string must be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature you will be working with is: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`.

Thank you for your attention, and I wish you the best of luck with this task!"""
