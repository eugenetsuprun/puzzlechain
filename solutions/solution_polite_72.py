"""You are kindly requested to develop a function that, given a string containing digits from 2 to 9 inclusive, will return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. The results may be presented in any order you prefer.

The mapping of the digits to their corresponding letters, similar to the layout on telephone buttons, is as follows:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

Please note that the input string may contain some non-digit characters, such as ones or zeros, which should be filtered out prior to processing.

Here are a few examples for your reference:

Example 1:
- Input: digits = "23"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
- Input: digits = ""
- Output: []

Example 3:
- Input: digits = "2"
- Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
- Input: digits = "12*30"
- Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

As a gentle reminder, please keep in mind the following constraints:
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- Each digits[i] is a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature for your solution should be: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]"""

        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and keep only valid digits
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_letters, digits))
