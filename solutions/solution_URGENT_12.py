"""You must act NOW to solve this urgent coding challenge! Given a string of digits ranging from 2-9, your task is to return all possible letter combinations that these numbers could represent. Time is of the essence, so focus on filtering out any non-digit characters, ones, or zeros immediately!

Refer to the mapping below:

- Button 2: ABC
- Button 3: DEF
- Button 4: GHI
- Button 5: JKL
- Button 6: MNO
- Button 7: PQRS
- Button 8: TUV
- Button 9: WXYZ

You must deliver the answer in any order! 

Consider these scenarios as examples to guide your solution:

Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:
Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:
Input: digits = "12*30"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Remember, the constraints are as follows:

- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- Each digits[i] is guaranteed to be a digit within the range ['2', '9'].

You need to implement the function with the signature: `letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]`

Donâ€™t delay! The clock is ticking!"""

    if not digits:

        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    # Filter out non-digit characters and ones or zeros
    filtered_digits = ''.join(filter(lambda x: x in digit_to_char, digits))
    
    if not filtered_digits:
