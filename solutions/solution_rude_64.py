"""Alright genius, listen up. You've got a string packed with digits from 2 to 9, and your pathetic job is to whip up all the possible letter combos those numbers could stand for. Just like those old-school phone keypads. You know the drill:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

Oh, and if you see any junk like non-digit characters, or even zeros and ones, just toss them out like yesterday's trash.

Here are some sad little examples to guide you:

Example 1:  
Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

But don’t screw this up—keep in mind the constraints:  
0 <= digits.length <= 4  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

Your function should look like this: 
letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]  

Now get to it!"""

    if not digits:
        return []
